# MyVector
	Description: 
		The myvector<T> class will try to eliminate the disadvantage of std::vector<T> by using a linked data structure of array “chunks”. 
		When a “chunk” becomes full, we’ll simply link on another chunk instead of reallocating and copying elements. 
		The result is a data structure much like a linked-list, except that each node holds multiple elements instead of one.
